# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart Function

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in Dart asynchronous programming: improper exception handling using `rethrow`.  The example showcases how exceptions are caught and re-thrown, allowing for higher-level handling or logging.

The `bug.dart` file contains the initial code with the potential for unhandled exceptions, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a more robust approach.  This example helps developers understand the importance of exception handling when working with asynchronous operations in Dart.
